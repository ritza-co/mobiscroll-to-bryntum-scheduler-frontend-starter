## Get Mobiscroll Scheduler CSS and JS files

Go to the [Mobiscroll](https://mobiscroll.com/) home page and enter your email in the navigation input or at the bottom of the page to create a Mobiscroll account and start your free trial. Go to the [Mobiscroll download page](https://download.mobiscroll.com) and click on the "Event calendar & scheduling" card. Pick "JavaScript" in the Pick a framework section. This will download a `mobiscroll.javascript.trial.zip` file to your computer. Unzip the file and copy the `css` and `js` folders to the root folder of this project. The Mobiscroll CSS and JS files are added to the app in the `index.html` file.
